# Turtle Race Game

This is a simple Turtle Race game built using the Python `turtle` module. The game allows the user to predict which turtle will win the race among eight different colored turtles. Each turtle moves forward by a random amount in each iteration, and the first turtle to cross the finish line wins.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the color of the turtle you think will win the race when prompted.
3. Watch the race and see if your chosen turtle wins!

## Setup and Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the `turtle` module if it is not already installed.
3. Save the script to a file (e.g., `turtle_race.py`).
4. Run the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python turtle_race.py
    ```
